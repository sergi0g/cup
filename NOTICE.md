Hello,

I have an important announcement to make.

### The situation

You may have noticed that the last few months Cup's development has stalled. I had very little time to work on it. Tomorrow, the 11th of September, 2025, I am starting my last year of school. It is very important to me to get into a good university, so I will be studying all day, with no time to work on my projects.

What this means for you is that the development of Cup is paused, at least until June 2026. That means no new features and no bugfixes. If Cup works fine for you and you're comfortable with not getting any updates (this does _not_ mean Cup is suddenly insecure by the way), you can keep using it. Otherwise, there are many alternatives you can look at, which are actively maintained and may provide the features you need.

### How you can help

If you're a Rust developer, I would really appreciate it if you could start contributing to Cup. There are a bunch of open issues that need to be worked on. I can find some time to review PRs. You can also fork the repository and do your own thing, if you prefer.

I've also left a few new features in the `v4` branch and a rewrite I started in `rewrite`, because I feel like the code is unmaintainable in its current state. I'd love it if someone could help work on that.

That's all I had to say. I'm sorry if I let you down, this was a really hard decision to make. I would like to thank all of you for your help and support, it really means a lot to me. I hope I can continue working on the project once I'm done with my final exams!
