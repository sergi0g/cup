# Using the latest version

The installation instructions you previously followed describe how to install Cup's stable version.

However, it is only updated when a new release is created, so if you want the latest features, you'll need to install Cup's nightly version.

Cup's nightly version always contains the latest changes in the main branch.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  There is no guarantee that the nightly version will always work. There may be
  breaking changes or a bad commit and it may not work properly. Install nightly
  only if you know what you are doing. These instructions will assume you have
  the technical know-how to follow them. If you do not, please use the stable
  release!

## With Docker

Instead of `ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup`, use `ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup:nightly`

## As a binary

Go to a [nightly workflow run](https://github.com/sergi0g/cup/actions/workflows/nightly.yml) and download the artifact for your system.
