# As a binary

## Introduction

This guide will help you install Cup from a binary.

## Installation

<Steps>
### Download binary
Go to https://github.com/sergi0g/cup/releases/latest.

Depending on your system's architecture, choose the binary for your system. For example, for an `x86_64` machine, you should download `cup-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`

<Callout>
You can use the command `uname -i` to find this
</Callout>
### Add binary to path
Move the binary you downloaded to a directory in your path. You can usually get a list those directories by running `echo $PATH`. On most Linux systems, moving it to `~/.local/bin` is usually enough.
</Steps>

That's it! Cup is ready to be used. Head over to the Usage page to get started.
