# Integrations

At the moment, Cup has no built-in integrations, but it provides an API for the server and JSON output for the CLI, which can enable you to connect Cup to your own integrations.

## JSON data

The data returned from the API or from the CLI is in JSON and looks like this:

```jsonc
{
    // Statistics useful for displaying on dashboards.
    // You could calculate these yourself based on the rest of the data,
    // but they're provided for easier integration with other systems.
    "metrics": {
        "monitored_images": 5,
        "up_to_date": 2,
        "updates_available": 3,
        "major_updates": 1,
        "minor_updates": 0,
        "patch_updates": 0,
        "other_updates": 2,
        "unknown": 0,
    },
    // A list of image objects with all related information.
    "images": [
        {
            "reference": "ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup:latest",
            "parts": {
                // The information Cup extracted about the image from the reference. Mostly useful for debugging and the way the web interface works.
                "registry": "ghcr.io",
                "repository": "sergi0g/cup",
                "tag": "latest",
            },
            "result": {
                "has_update": true, // `true` when an image has an update of any kind, `false` when up to date and `null` when unknown.
                "info": {
                    // `null` if up to date
                    "type": "digest", // Can also be `version` when Cup detects the tag contains a version.
                    // If `type` is "digest":
                    "local_digests": [
                        // A list of local digests present for the image
                        "sha256:b7168e5f6828cbbd3622fa19965007e4611cf42b5f3c603008377ffd45a4fe00",
                    ],
                    "remote_digest": "sha256:170f1974d8fc8ca245bcfae5590bc326de347b19719972bf122400fb13dfa42c", // Latest digest available in the registry
                    // If `type` is "version":
                    "version_update_type": "major", // Loosely corresponds to SemVer versioning. Can also be `minor` or `patch`.
                    "new_version": "v3.3.3", // The tag of the latest image.
                },
                "error": null, // If checking for the image fails, will be a string with an error message.
            },
            "time": 869, // Time in milliseconds it took to check for the update. Useful for debugging.
            "server": "Lithium", // The name of the server which the image was checked for updates on. `null` if from the current machine.
        },
    ],
}

    Please keep in mind that the above may not always be up to date. New fields
    may be added, or some types extended. If you notice that, just open an issue
    and they'll be updated. Changes to the JSON data schema will _always_ happen
    in a backwards-compatible way. In case backwards-incompatible changes are
    made, these docs will be updated. For something more up-to-date, you can
