# Theme

Cup initially had a blue theme which looked like this:

<Image alt="Screenshot of blue theme" src={blue} />

This was replaced by a more neutral theme which is now the default:

<Image alt="Screenshot of neutral theme" src={neutral} />

However, you can get the old theme back by adding the `theme` key to your `cup.json`
Available options are `default` and `blue`.

Here's an example:

```jsonc
{
  "theme": "blue"
  // Other options
}
```

Note that the difference between the 2 themes is almost impossible to perceive when your system is in light mode.
