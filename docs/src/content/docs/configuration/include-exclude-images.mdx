# Include/Exclude images

If you want to exclude some images (e.g. because they have too many tags and take too long to check), you can add the following to your config:

```jsonc
{
  "images": {
    "exclude": [
        "ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-machine-learning",
        "postgres:15"
    ]
    // ...
  }
  // Other options
}
```

For an image to be excluded, it must start with one of the strings you specify above. That means you could use `ghcr.io` to exclude all images from ghcr.io or `ghcr.io/sergi0g` to exclude all my images (why would you do that?).


If you want Cup to always check some extra images that aren't available locally, you can modify your config like this:
```jsonc
{
  "images": {
    "extra": [
        "mysql:8.0",
        "nextcloud:30"
    ]
    // ...
  }
  // Other options
}
```

Note that you must specify images with version tags, otherwise Cup will exit with an error!
