# Introduction

<Image src={cup} unoptimized />

Cup is a lightweight alternative to [What's up Docker?](https://github.com/getwud/wud) written in Rust.

# Features ✨

- 🚀 Extremely fast. Cup takes full advantage of your CPU and is hightly optimized, resulting in lightning fast speed. On my Raspberry Pi 5, it took 3.7 seconds for 58 images!
- Supports most registries, including Docker Hub, ghcr.io, Quay, lscr.io and even Gitea (or derivatives)
- Doesn't exhaust any rate limits. This is the original reason I created Cup. It was inspired by [What's up docker?](https://github.com/getwud/wud) which would always use it up.
- Beautiful CLI and web interface for checking on your containers any time.
- The binary is tiny! At the time of writing it's just 5.2 MB. No more pulling 100+ MB docker images for a such a simple program.
- JSON output for both the CLI and web interface so you can connect Cup to integrations. It's easy to parse and makes webhooks and pretty dashboards simple to set up!
