# With Docker
## Introduction

This guide will help you install Cup as a Docker container. It is the easiest installation method and also makes updating Cup very easy.

## Installation

To get started, open up a terminal and run the following command.
```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup
```
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
If you aren't in the `docker` group, please ensure you run all commands as a user who does. In most cases, you'll just need to prefix the `docker` commands with `sudo`
</Callout>

That's it! Cup is ready to be used. Head over to the Usage page to get started.
