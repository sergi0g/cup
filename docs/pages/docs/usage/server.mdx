This will launch the server on port `8000`. To access it, visit `http://<YOUR_IP>:8000` (replace `<YOUR_IP>` with the IP address of the machine running Cup.)

<Callout>
The URL `http://<YOUR_IP>:8000/api/v3/json` is also available for usage with integrations.

## Use a different port

Pass the `-p` argument with the port you want to use

```ansi
$ cup serve -p 9000

## Usage with Docker

If you're using the Docker image, just replace all occurences of `cup` in the examples with `docker run -tv /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p <PORT>:<PORT> ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup`, where `<PORT>` is the port Cup will be using.

For example, this:

```bash /serve -p 9000/
$ cup serve -p 9000
```

becomes:

```bash /serve -p 9000/
$ docker run -tv /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 9000:9000 ghcr.io/sergi0g/cup serve -p 9000
```
