# Insecure registries

For the best security, Cup only connects to registries over SSL (HTTPS) by default. However, for people running a local registry that haven't configured SSL, this may be a problem.

To solve this problem, `cup.json` has an `"insecure_registries"` option which allows you to specify exceptions

Here's what it looks like:

```json
{
    "insecure_registries": ["<INSECURE_REGISTRY_1>", "<INSECURE_REGISTRY_2>"],
    // Other options
}
```

When configuring an insecure registry that doesn't run on port 80, don't forget to specify it (i.e. use `localhost:5000` instead of `localhost` if your registry is running on port `5000`)
