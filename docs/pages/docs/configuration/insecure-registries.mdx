# Insecure registries

For the best security, Cup only connects to registries over SSL (HTTPS) by default. However, for people running a local registry that doesn't support SSL, this may be a problem.

To solve this problem, you can specify exceptions in your `cup.json`.

Here's what it looks like:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "<INSECURE_REGISTRY_1>": {
      "insecure": true
      // Other options
    },
    "<INSECURE_REGISTRY_2>" {
      "insecure": true
      // Other options
    },
    // ...
  }
  // Other options
}
```

  When configuring an insecure registry that doesn't run on port 80, don't
  forget to specify the port (i.e. use `localhost:5000` instead of `localhost` if your
  registry is running on port `5000`)
